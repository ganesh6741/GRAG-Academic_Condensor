# GRAG-Academic_Condensor
Modular GRAG project to summarize and analyze academic abstracts
# GRAG Academic Condenser

This project leverages Generative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) modules to condense academic abstracts into plain-language summaries, identify key takeaways, and answer contextual queries.

## Goals
- Clean and chunk academic abstracts
- Embed and store in a vector database
- Retrieve relevant info via user prompts
- Modular, scalable architecture

## Roadmap
1. Abstract ingestion & chunking
2. Embedding + vector search
3. GRAG flows: summarization, Q&A, novelty scoring
4. UX layer: CLI or Web Interface
5. Deployment & documentation
